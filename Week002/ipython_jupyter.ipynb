    "# Introduction to Magic Commands in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Magic commands are special commands in Jupyter Notebook that provide additional functionality beyond regular Python code. They are prefixed with one or two percent signs (`%` or `%%`) for line magics and cell magics, respectively. This notebook will guide you through various magic commands and how they can be used in data science workflows."

    "   * Line Magic (%): Line magics are commands that are prefixed by a single percent sign (%). They operate on a single line of code and are used by typing % followed by the command. For example, %timeit is a line magic used for timing the execution of a single line of code.\n",

    "   * Cell Magic (%%): Cell magics are commands that are prefixed by two percent signs (%%). They operate on multiple lines of code, typically the entire cell, and are used by typing %% followed by the command. For example, %%timeit is a cell magic used for timing the execution of multiple lines of code within a cell.\n",
